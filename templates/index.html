          WINT Water Intelligence is dedicated to helping businesses reduce
          their environmental footprint by preventing the hazards, costs, waste,
          and the sustainability impact of water leaks and wastage throughout a
          building's complete lifecycle – from construction to the operational
          phase. Utilizing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and IoT
          technology, WINT provides a solution for commercial facilities,
          construction projects and industrial manufacturers looking to cut
          water waste and its associated carbon emissions and to mitigate water
          damage in the property.
